# Expo Native App for DramaEcho

Drama Echo is a way for you to practice your pronunciation in a language you are learning.
To jump right in, try the demo app for Expo Go in the *About* section of this repo.
You will hear a video in a foreign language. You must listen to the phrases and try your best to repeat them. If you make a mistake, you can try again as many times as you wish.
